## 🎮 Actual Projects

### 📌 Rock, Paper or Scissors with an order 1 Markov Model
- Description**: Simulation of the classic game, where the automatic player makes decisions using a **first order Markov chain**.
- Objective**: Predict the opponent's next move based on his last move.
- Technologies**: Python, transition matrices, probabilistic logic.
